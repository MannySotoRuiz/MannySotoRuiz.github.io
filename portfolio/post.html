		<h3>University Course Registraion System using OOP</h3>

		<p>
		This was a project I started in Septemebr 2021 in my Data Structres class as a review about OOP from CS101. This was an indepedent project that I worked on which uses Java and covers many topics in OOP. Currently working on the GUI (pictures soon).
		<br>
		<br>
		In this situation, I am hired as a software developor by a new university in my hometown. The university wants me to design and implement a Course Registration System.
		<br>
		<br>
		In this program there is a login for either students or admins. Admins have the ability to visit Courses Managements or Reports. In Courses Managements, an admin can create, delete or edit a course, and register a student. In Reports, this is where the admin is allowed to view all courses, see which ones are full, and view a specific student's enrolled courses. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Students have the ability to view all courses, view which ones are not full, register or withdraw from a course, and view their current enrolled courses. 
		<br>
		<br>
